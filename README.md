This code demonstrates how to create a qualitative variable from a numeric value. It is a stripped-down version of the code I used in my dissertation. 
I analyzed opioid-related mortality and hospital discharge using spatial rules-based association data mining. This technique is also known as market basket analysis. 
In this type of analysis, instances of two or more qualitative values per record are used to create association rules.

I used this code to create qualitative quantile values from mortality and hospital discharge rates.
